## üìö Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **Docker Desktop** installed: [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. **Git** installed: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. **Node.js** (v20+) and **pnpm**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   ```bash
   # Install pnpm after Node.js
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [SGA Time Tracking repository](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Club-SCSU-University/sga-time-tracking)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone your forked repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sga-time-tracking.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd sga-time-tracking

# Add the original repository as "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Computer-Science-Club-SCSU-University/sga-time-tracking.git
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment

```bash
# Step 1: Start Docker Desktop (choose based on your OS)
# For macOS:
pnpm docker:start:mac

# For Linux:
pnpm docker:start:linux

# For Windows:
pnpm docker:start:win

# Step 2: Bootstrap the project (installs dependencies, sets up database, runs migrations)
pnpm bootstrap

# Step 3: Start all services (frontend, backend, database)
pnpm dev
```

That's it! The application should now be running:
- **Clock Kiosk**: http://localhost:3000
- **Members Hub**: http://localhost:3001
- **Django API**: http://localhost:8000/api

For testing, you can use these development accounts:
- **Alice Johnson** (Admin): `123456`
- **Bob Smith** (Chair): `234567`
- **Carol Lee** (Member): `345678`

## üíª Development Workflow

### 1. Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from upstream
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/` - for new features (e.g., `feature/add-timesheet-export`)
- `fix/` - for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/clock-in-validation`)
- `docs/` - for documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/api-middleware`)

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed
- Write/update tests if applicable

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Format your code
pnpm format

# Make sure everything still works
pnpm dev

# Test database operations
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add CSV export for timesheets"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve clock-out validation error"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` - new feature
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `docs:` - documentation changes
- `style:` - formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` - code restructuring
- `test:` - adding tests
- `chore:` - maintenance tasks

## üîÑ Submitting a Pull Request

### Step 1: Push Your Changes

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. Fill out the pull request template:

```markdown
